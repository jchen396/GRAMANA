# GRAMANA
GRAMANA is a free multiplayer word game on the browser.

## How to play
Enter a username and create a room to challenge your friends by connecting the letters to build your word and prevent your opponents from completing theirs.

You and your opponent will be given words that are anangrams to each other's. 
This makes it so that the players will be sharing the same letters while building different words.
The objective is to build your word by inputting letters on the grid on the left side of the play screen.
The letters can be connected vertically, horizontally, or diagonally in any direction. (similar to Scrabble and Gomoku)

In order for the game to start, there must be at least 2 active users in the room. When there are more than 2 users, there will be a waiting queue to take over the loser's spot.
The player list will display the scoreboard as well as the players' turn.
The color {red} will indicate the player 1's moves, and the color {blue} will show the player 2's.
Every player will have 15 seconds to make their move, when the timer runs out the turn will be automically skipped.
At the end of each match, the winner will be able to select thier next word within the time limit. If they do not choose a word, the word will be automatically chosen by the system.
If the board is filled without a winner, the match will result in a tie, and the match will be restarted with the same players.
Keep in mind there is a chat room at the bottom right. Feel free to use it to interact with other users in the room!
Last, but not least, have fun!
